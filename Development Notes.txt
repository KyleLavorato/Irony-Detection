Preprocessing:
 X Use the Non-Irony hashtag version (Other hashtags are there and fine)

 X Translate the emojis to english as before but make them normal words, not :thinking:
	[Removed duplicate emojis in the same tweet as they are often spammed in a row and could cause over fitting]

 - Translate basic emoticons to text as well
	[There are :( and :) and :)) at a minimum in the tweet dataset]

 X Remove links, they have no meaning in irony. (Could replace with a <URL> token)
	[Non-shortened links remain as they are a string that could hold meaning]

 - Maybe remove garbage characters like '|' that are just used as seperation characters

 X Attempt to segment compound hashtags into its seperate words; #freelesson -> #free #lesson
	[This is done but it is not the most accurate]
	- [Try adding a first step that will try camelcase segmenting if it is possible as it should always be right; #FreeDrinks -> #Free #Drinks]
	- [If the segmenter is left with a dangling 's' add it to the last word instead of making a new word]
		(0 | Chill #Rep #ost #Dead  #Domino #s #Haha face with tears of joyskull) EXAMPLE near bottom
	[I keep the # in the segmented as it is an artifact that could hold irony information the way people use it]
