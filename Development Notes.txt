Preprocessing:
 X Use the Non-Irony hashtag version (Other hashtags are there and fine)
 X Instead of removing non-unicode characters (emojis) translate them to an english word of their meaning
	[Removed duplicate emojis in the same tweet as they are often spammed in a row and could cause over fitting]
 X Remove links, they have no meaning in irony. (Could replace with a <URL> token)
	[Non-shortened links remain as they are a string that could hold meaning]
 - Maybe remove useless characters like '|' that are just used as seperation characters
